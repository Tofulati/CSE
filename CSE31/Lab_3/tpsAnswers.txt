1. Static (global variables), Stack (local variables), Heap (dynamic storage)
2.
    a. Three variables were declared.
    b. Two of them are pointers. ptr points to the memory location of 2 integer spaces and handle points to a 2d array the size of an integer pointer.
    c. These variables are stored in the stack.
    d. The memory pool points to the heap.

1. The program allocates space for a Node object and assigns iValue to 5 and fValue to 3.14.
2. 
    5
    0x16f8a7450
    0x155e05db0
    0x155e05db4
    0x155e05db8
3. All the values are stored side by side in the memory stack, where each the values are allocated near each other.
   The head is stored at a different memory location while the strucutre values are stored at a different location.
   This means that the head is within the same allocation but it points to the location of the structures.


* Individual 1 * 
1. You need to pass the size of the array because the program needs to ensure that there a terminating value
   since the arry would continue without the char.
2. The original array is changed at the end of the program.
3. A new array must be initialized because the main file asks for the original and sorted array which you can not
   get without having two arrays.
