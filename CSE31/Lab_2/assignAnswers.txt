* Assignment 1 *
1. The line that caused the segmentation fault was line 25.
2. To fix the program, you would need an & before the input like &input i.e (scanf("%d", &input)).
3. The values returned, but not the sum not sum. This results in the code returning 0s which are incorrect and invalid.
4. You fix this by returning values through reference and changing it so that the sum would be a pointer.

* Assignment 2 * 
1. Yes, the result is expected.
2. No, the result is not expected. The bug is that it wrote over the previous HELLO! string with HI!hi! since there is no terminating value.
3. The outcome is not expected. This is because there are spaces which would interfere with the strlen function and would return the wrong values for the for loop.
