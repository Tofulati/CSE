1. gcc -g punishment.c -o punish
2. lldb punish
3. run
4. 
    - Instruct the debugger to stop in a location of the code, giving control over the debugger to them. 
    - breakpoint set --file punish --line 29
5. next
6. p variable_name
7. continue
8. quit

1. 4 variables
2. All the values of the variables should be random numbers. This is because when you initialize the variables, c would put random numbers that were previously on the heap.
3. You would initialize the variables with actual numbers.
4. x = 0x16f577408, y = 0x16f577404
5. px value = 77208888, px address = 0x16b86f408, py value = 1, py address = 0x16b86f404
6. 45645156, 1, 1831318816, 1, 1831318592, 1, -1893022620, 957218817, 45645156, 1
7. They are the same.
8. This makes sense because the arr would always point to the first value no matter what. Arr[0] would just specify what point the pointer is pointing to.
