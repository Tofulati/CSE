odd and even sums in ints
temp and value ints
temp sum in int
counter starting at 1
digit counter (even/odd) starting at 0

prompt user to enter first value
scan first value

if value equals 0:
    print no average to compute
    end program

            int temp would find last value of temp

                subtract from tempSum
            else:
                add to tempSum
            shift values to the right one

    reset tempSum
    add one to counter

    if last and second last digit is 1 and not 11:

    scan for next value

if even not 0:
    print out average for evenSum
if odd not 0: 
    print out average for oddSum
