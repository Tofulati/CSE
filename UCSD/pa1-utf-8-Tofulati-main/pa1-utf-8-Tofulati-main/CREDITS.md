- ChatGPT: "How would you read UTF-8 encoded strings in C." There was not much useful information given about reading the strings, as it told me that C can read them normally with the error of ASCII characters. However, something that I took away from the generated answer was (unsigned char) as it would treat the first bit as a 0 or 1, which could be seen as a negative sign if not unsigned. I also learned this in previous college. In addition, I got some help with the way of masking and identifying whether the bytes would be starter and what their lengths were. Although it supplied some info on basic masking, I wanted to add on to it. This was also taught in class, but it wanted to elaborate on it. Throughout the code, I adjuste the way I masked utilizing & and inequalities, some of which that were mentioned by ChatGPT. Finally, something that I used ChatGPT to generate was some test cases. I knew it was going to be hard to print utf-8 characters since there would be the addition of variation chars which we haven't learned yet, but ChatGPT helped generate some of these cases without that character. I only utilized the test cases that it generated with the japanese characters and last char emojis.
