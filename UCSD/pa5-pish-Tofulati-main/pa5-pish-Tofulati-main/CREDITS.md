CHATGPT:
I needed help on how to address different inputs from the user in the run function. To address this, I asked CHATGPT to write a template about how to react to different arg commands. As a result of asking GPT this, it wrote me a pseudocode of the layout of the program, and added some example args within the template. This guided me in my layout and implementation of the different arguments provided by the user. In addition to this, I had some confusion about the PID and how to address correct commands and run them in child processes. I asked GPT to help explain how the PID and the child processes ran seperately and how to run them using execvp. After running the prompt, GPT provided a brief explaination of the PID and the child processes (similar to what Prof. Shalev explained), and it provided a pseudocode template for me to follow. With this information, I utilized this template to implement my code. Finally, I had some issues with dealing with printing on a file. This issue was dealt with during the lecture as Prof. Shalev addressed this. However, I had additional issues with writing singular characters in the file. So, I asked GPT to help me with a template for how to address writing only singular characters. Using the template it provided, I utilized the implementation in my code.
