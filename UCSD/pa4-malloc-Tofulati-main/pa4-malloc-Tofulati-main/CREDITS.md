CHATGPT: I was a little confused about where to start with this project. So I asked CHATGPT to explainto me what it meant to be 16 byte alligned, coalescing, and how to traverse through a heap with the headers and footers. As a result of these questions, CHATGPT responded with various examples of how the 16 byte allignment worked and how each block would be reachable with a 16 byte pointer. In addition to this, GPT explained how you can traverse through the heap with header pointers and footer pointers by pointer arthmetic. Moreover, GPT explained how you can incorporate coalescing when you traverse as well. With this information, I was able to incorporate my vmalloc and vmfree functions. 

Aside from getting help on the coding portion, I asked CHATGPT to explain some possible errors that I may have had if I failed a test case. I would pass in the output of the test case and some information about what my code should do and it would return the possible issue. Taking this information, I was able to understand how my code worked on a deeper level, in addition, it allowed me to create debugging statements to check my work. 

COPILOT: I didn't not ask many questions, I asked this model to explain how the heapstart size-status would vary in the way it acts depending on which part of the heap were allocated or freed. As a result of asking it this, I would get a detailed explaination of the concept for the heapstart. I used this information to incorporate with my implementations.
